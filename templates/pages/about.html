	<h1>About</h1>

	<hr>
	<p>
		My name is Lorenz, a web/game developer from Germany with a passion for exploring and learning new things.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am driven by curiosity and a desire to continuously learn and explore new ideas, which has led me on a journey from hardware development to embedded systems and eventually to web development and gaming.
	</p>
	<p>
		My interests lie in the field of system design, experimentation, and improving upon existing technologies through constant exploration and seeking out new ways of doing things.
